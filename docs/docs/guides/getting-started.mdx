This document aims to be a gentle introduction to the framework and its features.
It is an elementary preface with examples and links to other parts of the documentation.
Let's get start!

## Install

```sh
npm install @resver/rex
```

## Your First Server

```reason
open Rex;

let handler = HttpHandler.({verb, path, res}) => {
  switch (verb, path) {
  | (Verb.Get, []) => res |> Response.send("hello world")
  | _ => res |> Response.send("Not found")
  };
};

App.make(~port=3000, ~handler, ());
```
