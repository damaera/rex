title: ðŸŽ‰ Getting Started

This document aims to be a gentle introduction to the framework and its features.
It is an elementary preface with examples and links to other parts of the documentation.
Let's get start!

## Installation

Let's say that you've already has [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) installed
and already setup a
[ReasonML](https://reasonml.github.io/docs/en/installation) project.

```sh
$ npm install  --save resver-rex
```

then add it to `bsconfig.json`

```json
{
  ...
  "bs-dependencies": ["resver-rex"]
  ...
}
```

## Launch Server ðŸš€

```reason
/* file: Server.re */
open Rex;

let handler = HttpHandler.({verb, path, res}) => {
  switch (verb, path) {
  | (Verb.Get, []) => res |> Response.send("Hello world!")
  | _ => res |> Response.send("Not found")
  };
};

App.make(~port=3000, ~handler, ());
```

Your code should be compiled to `Server.bs.js`, then run

```
$ node ./Server.bs.js
```

then the app should live at `http://localhost:3000`

## Handler

there is only one function that run them all.
`~handler`.

**Params:**

```reason
req: Request.t, // request object
res: Response.t, // response object
verb: Verb.t, // HTTP Methods for example GET, POST, etc.
path: Path.t // list of string that separated by "/"
query: Js.Json.t, // query string
body: Body.t, // parsed body
pubsub: PubSub.t('a) // publish/subscribe (used in websocket)
```
